**Introduction to the assignment:**
The goal of this assignment is to create a data visualization about a week in our personal lives. For this, we had to collect the data ourselves by observing and recording our daily activities. I did this based on six assigned questions:

1. **What?**  —What did I do during the week? This refers to the activities and tasks I carried out, such as work, study, hobbies, sports, etc.

2. **Who?**  —Who did I spend my time with? This could be family members, friends, colleagues, or other people.

3. **Where?**  —Where did the activity take place? This could be at home, at the office, in a café, outdoors in nature, etc.

4. **When?**  —At what times of the day did I do these activities? This includes specific times or periods.

5. **Why?**  —Why did I do these activities? What was the motivation or reason behind each activity?

6. **How do I feel about it?**  —How did I feel during these activities? This is about emotions and mood, such as joy, stress, boredom, excitement, etc.

With these questions, I gained a better understanding of my daily routine and the emotions associated with it, which forms the basis for the data visualization.
