**Introduction to the assignment:**
For this assignment, we were asked to learn how to observe color. The task was as follows: we had to notice colors in our own environment and then photograph them. Ultimately, we had to choose a medium to present 10 color palettes that represent our surroundings.

This assignment is purely about learning to notice color.

The goal of my final medium is to showcase the beauty of color through an indexing system and to link feelings with every color. All of the colors are named after the feelings I experience when I look at them. By reflecting my environment, I hope to inspire viewers to have an inner reflection. This means that when looking at the final result of my colors, people won't know which feeling is linked to which color, as this is a personal experience.

In a way, I view this similarly when it comes to people. One cannot accurately gauge what feelings a person is experiencing on the inside just by looking at them. Even someone who always has a smile on their face might be experiencing doubts or negativity within.

With this thought process, I came up with the idea to provide, in addition to my 10 color palettes, a single blank wooden plaque with just a magnetic strip. This allows each viewer to create their own palette of feelings and find an intimate connection in my work, without revealing their own depth to the outside world. This can actually happen because all the colored plaques are magnetically attached to the wooden boards.
