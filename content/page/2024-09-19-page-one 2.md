In this portfolio, I’m showcasing work from my first bachelor, exploring a wide range of subjects and techniques. These pieces were created as part of academic projects, where I’ve developed and challenged my creative abilities. Each project reflects my growth as an artist and my pursuit of new ways to translate ideas into visual expression.

Hi! I'm Alison Kremer, a 20-year-old student currently pursuing my second bachelor's degree at LUCA School of Arts. My passion for creativity and exploration drives my work as I continue to develop my skills and artistic vision. As I dive deeper into my studies, I strive to blend innovation with personal expression, always seeking new challenges and perspectives in the world of art and design.
