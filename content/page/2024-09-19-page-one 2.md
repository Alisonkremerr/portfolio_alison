In this portfolio, I’m showcasing work from my first bachelor, exploring a wide range of subjects and techniques. These pieces were created as part of academic projects, where I’ve developed and challenged my creative abilities. Each project reflects my growth as an artist and my pursuit of new ways to translate ideas into visual expression.
